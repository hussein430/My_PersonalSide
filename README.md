My Personal Site

A simple, responsive personal portfolio website showcasing projects, skills, and ways to get in touch.

**Features**
- Clean, responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Projects section with images
- About and contact sections
- Lightweight, static site (no build step required)

**Tech Stack**
- HTML5, CSS3
- Images stored under `images/`

**Getting Started**
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Or serve locally for better routing/cache behavior:
  - With Python: `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000`

**Project Structure**
- `index.html`: Main page markup
- `images/`: All site images (avatars, project screenshots, backgrounds)

- Any static host (Netlify, Vercel, etc.) worksâ€”just deploy the repository root.
